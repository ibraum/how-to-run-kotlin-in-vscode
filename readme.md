# 🤺 HOW TO RUN KOTLIN PROGRAMS IN VSCODE
## ❤️ Tutos
- First we need to have JDK 17 or newer (Java Development Kit) installed on you machine
- we have to download kotlin compiler [**Download It Here**](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
- UnZip the file, copy and past it in the program files folder
- After that copy the path of the **bin** folder and past it in the **path** of environment  variables on your devices
- Open your CMD and enter this command

    - **kotlin** for version under **1.9**
    - **kotlin -Xrepl** for version greater than **1.9+**
- Search Kotlin extension in VSCode and install it 

    - Extension for format
    - Extension for autocompletion (if we want it)
    - Extension for run the code like **Code Runner**

- we can now open vscode, create your HelloWorld.kt kotlin file, and past this inside
```kotlin
    fun main() {
        println("Hello World!")
    }
```
- Press run button in vscode, we’ll see this output in the terminal. 
```terminal
    Hello World!
```
